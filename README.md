# Speech_recognition
This project is a web-based audio transcription application built using Streamlit and the SpeechRecognition library. Users can upload audio files in WAV or MP3 format, and the app will transcribe the audio content using Google's speech recognition API. The transcribed text can be easily downloaded as a text file.
