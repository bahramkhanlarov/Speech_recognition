# Speech Recognition and Audio Transcription 

- The project uses SpeechRecognition library in Python to implement speech recognition functionality . 
- I explain to install and use the SpeechRecognition package, and how to work with audio files and microphones for capturing speech data. 
- Using Streamlit and the SpeechRecognition library users can upload audio files in WAV or MP3 format, and the local web app will transcribe the audio content using Google's speech recognition API. 
- The transcribed text can be easily downloaded as a text file.
